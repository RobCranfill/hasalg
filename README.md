Hide-and-seek algorithm(s)

Whilst playing "Walkie-Talkie Hide-and-Seek" with some new friends,
I was wondering what, if any, special tricks or algorithms might be beneficial.

Hence this testbed.

I'm not sure this is going anywhere (haha).

## The rules
Mostly a two-player game, each gets a radio. "Seeker" counts to 100 with eyes closed (speaking over the radio), "hider" goes and hides somewhere *with a view of the area*. Then, as the seeker searches, the hider says "warmer" or "colder" as appropriate. Simple and fun!
